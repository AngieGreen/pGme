Inspired by placekitten, placeGant is a small helper for generating images of Gantman, Master of the Universe, for use as placeholders in your designs or code. Just put your desired image size (width & height) after this URL and you'll get a placeholder Gant.

EXAMPLE: For a 200x300 pixel image, link to http://placegant.me/pg/200/300 in your work.

placeGant can also be found as a Ruby gem at https://github.com/AngieGreen/placegant. 

To see all the images available, visit http://placegant.me.
